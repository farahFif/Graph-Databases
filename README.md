# BigData-Assignment-3
Graph Databases

In this assignment, we focus on graph databases for a couple of reasons. First, the first three categories provide limited query capabilities and are not of great interest. Second, the NewSQL paradigm strives to provide SQL support, and, from the user standpoint, is not very different from traditional databases. Graph databases, on the other hand, come with a capable query language that allows for complex analysis but is quite different from SQL.
